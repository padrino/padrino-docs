## New dependencies versions

Padrino v0.16 now requires Ruby >= 2.7.8. This change aligns us with Sinatra ~> 4.0, which we have also changed in this release. Consequently, this upgrade also requires an upgrade to Rack >= 3.0. These updates ensure that Padrino applications are running on secure, modern foundations and can leverage the latest performance improvements and features available from its dependencies.

## HTTP Server Configuration

> This is the only breaking change in this release.

`WEBrick` has been removed from the Ruby Standard Library as of Ruby 3.0. This means that applications relying on the default HTTP server will encounter issues when running on Ruby versions 3.0 and above. To upgrade properly, Padrino now requires developers to explicitly specify their preferred HTTP server in the Gemfile. If your application does not have a manual HTTP server defined, add `gem 'webrick'` to your Gemfile.

When creating a new Padrino application, you can choose a HTTP server with the `--server` (`-s`) option. The full set of options are: `thin`, `puma`, `spider-gazelle`, `mongrel`, `trinidad` (JRuby), and `webrick` (default).

## Codebase Updates for Ruby 3.4

We have performed a comprehensive refactoring of the codebase. Both the internal Padrino code and the code generated by our scaffolding tools have been updated to align with the syntax and best practices of Ruby 3.4. This ensures a cleaner, more efficient codebase and provides a better developer experience when working with generated files.
