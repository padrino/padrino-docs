title: Padrino 0.13.3.2 - small fixes, documentation cleanup, enable sqlite's file to deep tree of subdirectories, caching the content_type mime type
---

Padrino 0.13.3.2 was shipped in September 2016. This version contains small fixes, documentation cleanup, enable sqlite's file to deep tree of subdirectories, as well as fixing an issue with not caching the content_type mime type.


## Be able to create sqlite's file to deep tree of subdirectories.

[@karakava](https://github.com/kkarakawa "@karakava") was so nice to make the following possible when working with
[SQLite](https://sqlite.org/ "SQLite"):


```ruby
ActiveRecord::Base.configuration[:development] = {
  :adapter => 'sqlite3',
  :database => Padrino.root('db', 'development/1/sample.db')
}
```
