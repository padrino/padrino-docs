Want to show Padrino some love? Help out by contributing!


## Need help?

You can use our new [Padrino Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/padrino) or send us an
[email](mailto:padrinorb@gmail.com) or write a [message](http://github.com/padrino) also directly to our
[team](http://github.com/padrino/following). Also, be sure to join our official IRC channel at
[#padrino](irc://chat.freenode.net/#padrino) on [freenode](http://freenode.net) for live help.


## Find a bug?


Log it in GitHub by [creating a new issue](http://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/issues). Be sure to include all
relevant information, like the versions of Padrino and Ruby you're using. A [gist](http://gist.github.com/) of the code
that caused the issue as well as any error messages are also very helpful.


## Want to integrate a component?


Have a particular JavaScript engine you like? Know of a popular orm or testing framework that we have overlooked in
Padrino generators? We encourage you to contribute by creating a patch to integrate your favorite components into
Padrino! Check out the guide for [adding new components](http://www.padrinorb.com/guides/adding-new-components) to read
a detailed walk through of how to do this!


## Have a patch?

Bugs and feature requests that include patches are much more likely to get attention. Here are some guidelines that will
help ensure your patch can be applied as quickly as possible:


- Use [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](http://github.com/): The easiest way to get setup is to fork the
  [padrino repo](http://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework). Or, post a comment, if the patch is doc related.
- Write unit tests: If you add or modify functionality, it must include unit tests. If you don't write tests, we have
  to, and this can hold up acceptance of the patch.
- Mind the README: If the patch adds or modifies a major feature, modify the README.rdoc file to reflect that. Again, if
  you don't update the README, we have to, and this holds up acceptance.
- Push it: Once you're ready, push your changes to a topic branch and add a note to the ticket with the URL to your
  branch. Or, say something like, "you can find the patch on johndoe/foobranch‚Äù.


**NOTE:** we will take whatever we can get. If you prefer to attach diffs in emails to the mailing list, that's fine;
but do know that someone will need to take the diff through the process described above and this can hold things up
considerably.


## Want to write docs?


The process for contributing to Padrino's website or documentation is as simple as emailing us for access to modifying
the pages and guides within our site. Simply email [padrinorb@gmail.com](mailto:padrinorb@gmail.com) if you would like
to be able to contribute to improving our documentation.


## Looking for something to do?

If you'd like to help out but aren't sure how, take a look at the
[GitHub Issues](http://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/issues) page. If you find something that looks interesting,
leave a comment on the ticket noting that you're investigating (a simple "Taking..." is fine). Once you've worked on a few
issues, someone will add you as an assignee.
