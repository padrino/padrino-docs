Padrino has really shaped up to be an excellent framework and a pleasure to develop in on top of Sinatra.  The important
thing is that Padrino tries to take everything that developers love about Sinatra and enhance these features to make
them even better. Padrino also provides critical functionality missing from Sinatra such as baked-in localization, dead
simple mail delivery and form helpers.


To learn more about Padrino and to start using it for your web development, check out the [Guides Section](/guides) for
a detailed reference on Padrino's major components. In addition, checkout the [Padrino RDoc](/api) for a more complete
look at the framework. Specifically, you might want to start with the [Blog Tutorial](/guides/blog-tutorial) which walks
through the step by step development of building a basic blog using Padrino.
