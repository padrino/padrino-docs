In this article we'll cover two topics:

1. Integrating Padrino Admin Authentication into all apps within your project
2. Enabling custom authentication strategies within the authentication system


Before we begin, it is important to note that our integrated authentication based on project-roles can interact easily
with other systems. The only files that need to be changed are `session.rb` and `account.rb` in order to add your own
custom code.


So, let's start by creating a project using activerecord:


    $ padrino g project foo -orm activerecord -tiny
    $ cd foo
    $ bundle install


Now we need to add a model called `Account` to act as our persistence model:


    $ padrino g model Account name:string email:string role:string uid:string provider:string

    ---------- --------------------------
    name       the name of the account
    email      the email of the account
    role       the access control role
    uid        omniauth uid
    provider   omniauth provider
    ---------- --------------------------


Now we need to create and migrate our database:


    $ padrino rake ar:create ar:migrate


Open your favorite editor and browse and edit `Gemfile` and add `omniauth`:


    # Gemfile
    gem 'omniauth'


Now, run bundle install to install dependencies:


    $ bundle install


Now we need to add the `omniauth middleware`. Here you can choose two ways:


1. Add the middleware project-wide (so every subapp can use it)
2. Add the middleware only to the one app that requires it


In our example, we need to edit simply `app/app.rb` and add:


```ruby
# app/app.rb
use OmniAuth::Builder do
provider :twitter, 'consumer_key', 'consumer_secret'
provider :facebook, 'app_id', 'app_secret'
end
```


If you are in a multiapp scenario you need to edit `config/boot.rb`:


```ruby
# config/boot.rb
Padrino.use OmniAuth::Builder do
provider :twitter, 'consumer_key', 'consumer_secret'
provider :facebook, 'app_id', 'app_secret'
end

# before the line
Padrino.load!
```


To obtain an `app_id` and secret for Facebook, you need to:


- Go to the [Facebook Developers Page](http://www.facebook.com/developers)
- Browse and click [create a new app](http://www.facebook.com/developers/createapp.php)
- Set your app name and complete the formâ€¦
- One you finish that you are allowed to edit your settings, go to **website** section
- Add to site url: `http://localhost:3000`
- Add to domain: `localhost`
- Write the **Application ID** and **Application Secret** to the `OmniAuth::Builder`


To obtain a `consumer_key` and `consumer_secret` for Twitter, you need to:


- Go to [Twitter Applications Page](https://developer.twitter.com/apps/new)
- Insert all details and be sure to check **Application Type: Browser**
- Set a callback url with a valid domain ex: `www.mydomain.com/auth/twitter/callback`
- Save and go to **Application Settings** and **Manage Domains**
- Be sure that you can see your example domain: `www.mydomain.com/auth/twitter/callback`
- Authorize domain: `localhost`
- Now go to **Application Details** and save `Consumer key` and `Consumer Secret` to the `OmniAuth::Builder`


**NOTE**: For domain, it is not important that this path exist because `omniauth` changes the callback url.


Next, we can integrate our authentication system within in `app/app.rb`:


```ruby
# app/app.rb
# at the top before the class definition
register Padrino::Admin::AccessControl

set :login_page, "/" # determines the url login occurs

access_control.roles_for :any do |role|
role.protect "/profile"
role.protect "/admin" # here a demo path
end

# now we add a role for users
access_control.roles_for :users do |role|
role.allow "/profile"
end
```


And add a couple useful routes, edit `app/controllers.rb` with:


```ruby
# app/controllers.rb
get :index do
haml <<-HAML.gsub(/^ {6}/, '')
Login with
=link_to('Facebook', '/auth/facebook')
or
=link_to('Twitter', '/auth/twitter')
HAML
end

get :profile do
  content_type :text
  current_account.to_yaml
end

get :destroy do
  set_current_account(nil)
  redirect url(:index)
end

get :auth, :map => '/auth/:provider/callback' do
  auth = request.env["omniauth.auth"]
  account = Account.find_by_provider_and_uid(auth["provider"],
  auth["uid"]) ||
  Account.create_with_omniauth(auth)
  set_current_account(account)
  redirect "[http://](http://)" + request.env["HTTP_HOST"] +
  url(:profile)
end
```


We invoked a method `Account.create_with_omniauth` above, so edit `app/models/account.rb` and add:


```ruby
# app/models/account.rb
def self.create_with_omniauth(auth)
  create! do |account|
    account.provider = auth["provider"]
    account.uid = auth["uid"]
    account.email = auth["name"]
    account.email = auth["user_info"]["email"] if auth["user_info"] # we
    get this only from FB
    account.role = "users"
  end
end
```


That should just about do it! Let's start the server:


    $ padrino start


Browse [http://localhost:3000/profile](http://localhost:3000/profile)


That will kickoff to the `login_page`, in our case `/`.


Now you can login here [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


Follow your login process and then if needed [http://localhost:3000/destroy](http://localhost:3000/destroy)


That is all you need to setup a barebones authentication system in Padrino. This post has gotten you started with a
working "Account" and role based authentication solution with integrated omniauth support. From here, obviously there
are a number of other features you might want to add on top to flesh out, and that is left for another post or as an
exercise to the reader.
