:title: Oâ€™Reilly Sinatra - Up and Running Book!
---

With our growing community, its great that we have a book on the shelf to guide us through some of the more intricate
details of Sinatra from both a seasoned author and the maintainer of the project. The Sinatra book itself totes a great
description of what it entails:


> Sinatra gives developers a small but powerful and scalable framework
> for building web applications with
> Ruby. This introduction gets readers started, helping them to build,
> install, and polish a first application.
> It also explores how Sinatra fits in the web application ecosystem,
> especially in comparison to its far larger
> cousin, Ruby on Rails.


Definitely looking forward to getting this book. Show your support and thanks to both
[Alan](https://twitter.com/Anachronistic) and [Konstantin](https://twitter.com/konstantinhaase) for releasing this
awesome title!
