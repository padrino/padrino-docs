You can visit the [Padrino episode](http://thechangelog.com/post/708173099/episode-0-2-7-padrino-ruby-web-framework)
page to view the entire show notes with excellent related links and resources mentioned in the discussion.


We would also like to reiterate a few resources here which are particularly valuable for Padrino developers:


- [Rack Website](http://rack.rubyforge.org) - If you are using Padrino , you should eventually become familiar with the
  underlying “Rack” architecture. It is easy to understand and really helps give you a better picture of what is
  involved with a web application behind the scenes.
- [CodeRack](http://coderack.org) - Rack middleware is an excellent way to add functionality to your project without
  having to do any implementation work in your application. There is rack middleware to do everything from
  [displaying a captcha](http://github.com/achiu/rack-recaptcha) to
  [authenticating users](http://github.com/intridea/omniauth) and
  even [bundling your assets](http://github.com/juliocesar/rack-bundle)
- [Presto](http://github.com/pengwynn/presto) - Wynn’s shameless port of Nesta CMS to Padrino powering his own site
- [Padrino Extensions](http://wiki.github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/extensions)
- A starting set of Padrino extensions and recommended libraries for various common requirements


The Padrino team would like to thank [Adam](http://adamstacoviak.com) and [Wynn](http://wynnnetherland.com) very much
for this excellent show they put together every week and for having us on to discuss Padrino at length.  We know both of
them are fans of Padrino and just chatting with them was great fun.
