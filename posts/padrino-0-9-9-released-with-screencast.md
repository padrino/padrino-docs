The Padrino team has been working hard on preparing the framework and documentation for wider scale usage. This website
now contains a great deal of useful resources such as the many [guides](http://padrinorb.com/guides),
[contribution guidelines](http://www.padrinorb.com/pages/contribute), [team information](http://padrinorb.com/team),
[release notes](http://padrinorb.com/changes), among much more.


All of us are excited for Padrino to be tested and experimented with by the larger Sinatra community. Padrino is indeed
a ‘full-stack’ framework but it never strays away from the Sinatra philosophy to keep things simple and lightweight. In
fact, the Padrino functionality has been built to be as modular as possible.


If you do not want to build a full Padrino application, but would like to take advantage of certain enhancements such as
the [application helpers](http://www.padrinorb.com/guides/application-helpers),
[enhanced routing](http://www.padrinorb.com/guides/controllers), or the
[mail delivery](http://www.padrinorb.com/guides/padrino-mailer) be sure to check out how to
[utilize Padrino within an existing Sinatra application](http://www.padrinorb.com/guides/standalone-usage-in-sinatra).
