title: Padrino Weekly, Issue 2: Simple apps, Website now Open Source
---

[Simple Apps](http://github.com/padrino/single-apps) are a collection of very simple apps, each one demonstrating a
feature or a set of features. They are a great stop if you’re interested in learning Padrino or seeing a sample
implementation of a feature. They can also be used as a starting point to tinker around with a feature. Currently all
apps still need Padrino edge, so be a little careful when trying to port parts to your own apps.


The [Padrino Website](http://github.com/padrino/padrino-web) was pushed to GitHub. Well, it’s been there for a while
but now we made it public. The website certainly uses Padrino and serves as an example of a more elaborate project,
going far beyond of what a tutorial, guide or sample app could do. Feel free to check it out, try and break it - and if
you find any bugs, we’d like to hear about them.
