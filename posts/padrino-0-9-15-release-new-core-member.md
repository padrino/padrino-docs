With the templates and plugins generator in Padrino we can now generate a project with a template using:


```ruby
padrino-gen project my_project -p
path/to/my/template.rb -r=path/to/your/project
```


For existing plugins that you want to have installed into your project, use the plugin generator:


```ruby
padrino-gen plugin hoptoad
```


A list of available plugins are kept at [padrino-recipes](http://github.com/padrino/padrino-recipes). The plugin
generator can also accept a path to a ruby file or even a gist as well! View the
[guides](http://www.padrinorb.com/guides/generators#plugin-generator) for more information!


This version also provides new additions such as, a variety of new components to Padrino:


- erubis - renderer(thanks to cored)

- mongomatic - orm(thanks to lusis)
- ohm - orm(thanks to lusis)

new translations such as:
