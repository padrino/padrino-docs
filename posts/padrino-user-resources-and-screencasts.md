First, I would love to hear more of all your thoughts about this subject. Email us, leave comments, send us GitHub
messages about what you would like to see while learning Padrino.  This is really important in trying to understand the
next steps to improving the Padrino experience.

Second, the desire for more screencasts is noted. One interesting screencast the Padrino team would love to see is a
Padrino Peepcode video that builds on the basics taught in the Sinatra screencast. There is a feedback forum for
Peepcode here: [Peepcode Padrino Screencast](http://suggestions.peepcode.com/forums/15-general/suggestions/1064769-padrino). If you are interested in a
high quality video going in-depth about the various aspects of Padrino, let Peepcode know. We would be very excited to
see this come to fruition.


Third, we welcome contributors. If you want to improve documentation, add tutorials or pages to our website
documentation, add Padrino guides, or anything else to improve the state of Padrino, please let us know! We are happy
to talk with you and work with you to make Padrino an easier to use web development framework.


Thanks for reading and I appreciate the support given by the Padrino community.
