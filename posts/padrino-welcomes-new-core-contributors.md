#### Florian Gilcher ([skade](http://github.com/skade))

Is a great Sinatra coder that helps make Padrino work best in standalone/sinatra scenarios. He is a long term Ruby
programmer and runs the largest german ([Ruby community/board](http://ruby-portal.de)).


#### Joshua Hull ([joshbuddy](http://github.com/joshbuddy))

Is the author of the [Usher](http://github.com/joshbuddy/usher) routing library which Padrino relies on quite heavily
to support our advanced routing functionality. Our team has been working closely with him to improve both Usher and
Padrino’s routing capabilities. Josh is responsible for Padrino routing functionality and will enhance our speed and
decrease memory usage.


#### Lori Holden ([lholden](http://github.com/lholden))

An Open Source proponent since ‘93 with a passion for software development.  Previously part of the Merb team, her
support will help us throughout with code optimizations, test coverage improvements and new features on Padrino.


Our team is excited to have these new members aboard and to see what they will help us accomplish for the future
capabilities and functionalities of the Padrino framework. Stay tuned for our next version, 0.9.11, which will have
many improvements, bug fixes, and more!
