Be sure that your gem system is updated:


    $ gem update -system


Next, install the framework as a gem:


    $ gem install padrino


This will install the necessary padrino sub-gems to get you started.

Now you are ready to use this gem to enhance your sinatra projects or to create new Padrino applications.
