# Guides

When getting started with Sinatra or Padrino for the first time, we recommend
that you check out the [Getting Started](/guides/getting-started "Getting
Started") guide which provides an overview of the rest of our resources. Also be
sure to check out the [Blog Tutorial](/guides/blog-tutorial "Blog Tutorial") for
a step-by-step walkthrough of building your first Padrino project.

Padrino consists of multiple modules which enhance Sinatra in different ways.
The major components are described in detail below:

- [Getting Started](/guides/getting-started "Getting Started")
- [Generators](/guides/generators "Generators")
- [Application Helpers](/guides/application-helpers "Application Helpers")
- [Controllers and Routing](/guides/controllers "Controllers and Routing")
- [Development and Terminal Commands](/guides/development-commands "Development
  and Terminal Commands")
- [Mounting Sub-applications](/guides/mounting-applications "Mounting
  Sub-applications")
- [Delivering Mail](/guides/padrino-mailer "Delivering Mail")
- [Admin and Authentication](/guides/padrino-admin "Admin and Authentication")
- [Site Caching](/guides/caching-support "Site Caching")

Note that as a user of Padrino, each of the major components can be used
[standalone](/guides/standalone-usage-in-sinatra "standalone") in an existing
Sinatra application or used together for a full-stack Padrino project.
